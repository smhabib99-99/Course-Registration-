# Course-Registration

##  Questions
1.Add at least 3 Project features 
2.Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project.

##Q1. Ans:

In this project there is some features but here I will add three features.

1.Single course selection:
  -If a person accidentally or intentionally try to add same course twice 
  he/she can't take it because it is unnecessary to buy same course twice
  and waste of money and there is no logic behind it.

2.Alert  message:
  -This is the features of this web app when people will click twice in the
  same course or break the validation that implemented in the app.

3.Cart Section:
  -It is a most important features of this project because if a person buy 
  some course he/she should be shown in some where that they bought the course.
  Cart is the section where all of this is shown. like total credit, course name etc.




##Q2. Ans:

 -for managing state in this project, we can talk aobut useState() funciton .
 first of all, we need to import useState hook and react in local component.
 secondly, declaring state variable and state function for storing value of 
 the component.
 thirdly, we can easily use or update useState() set function's for our need 
 to manipulate data.
 example of useState(): 
    const [price,setPrice] = useSate(0)

 At the very end, we can also use useEffect() function for using data to load.
